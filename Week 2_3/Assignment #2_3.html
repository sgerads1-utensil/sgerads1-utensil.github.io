2 points: showcase your layout using Figma (link) 
1 point: student submits their code 
0-17 points: Studentâ€™s assignment has demonstrated deliverables of the assignment

--- Deliverables:

The proper HTML structure (!Doc type, head, body etc...)  -- YOU WILL DO THIS ANYWAY
Implement either a linked css or included css -  DO NOT USE INLINE -- ALSO YOU WILL DO THIS ANYWAY WHEN YOU CREATE YOUR FILE
 Create a layout using either flex, grid or positions - Surprise, this will also be done anyway. 
 Create a nav section 
Create two sections 
Create two parents and two children
Implement fonts, colors and font sizes 
Use pseudoclasses for your links 
The layout should include more than 3 (three) divs  -- THIS WILL BE ACCOMPLISHED VERY EASILY 
 Create elements using padding, margins and borders (hint: buttons make this really easy) 
Position anything using one of these position types: absolute, relative or sticky
Style the elements and your layout
