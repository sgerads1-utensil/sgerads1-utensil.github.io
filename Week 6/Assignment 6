Week 6: Final Project Pitch

Questions!
1) I plan to have both the “splitter” and “tracker” in the same HTML file. Is it better to use JavaScript to toggle a CSS class to toggle between the two views, or should I create two separate HTML pages?
2) For the budget tracker, if the user refreshes the page, I’m pretty sure their list will disappear. Should I look into local storage to save their list, or is it okay if the data resets for this project?
